---

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with a **modern, minimalistic, and luxury** aesthetic. Every design should feel premium, refined, and intentional.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Core Design Philosophy

**MODERN**: Clean lines, contemporary patterns, cutting-edge but timeless. Think Apple, Stripe, Linear.

**MINIMALISTIC**: Every element earns its place. Generous whitespace. Restraint is sophistication. Remove until you can't.

**LUXURY**: Premium feel through subtle details. Quality over quantity. Refined typography. Deliberate color. Attention to micro-interactions.

## Design Principles

Before coding, commit to these principles:

1. **Less is More**: Strip away the unnecessary. If an element doesn't serve a clear purpose, remove it.
2. **Whitespace as Design**: Generous negative space creates breathing room and elegance.
3. **Typographic Hierarchy**: Let typography do the heavy lifting. One or two carefully chosen fonts.
4. **Subtle Motion**: Elegant transitions, not flashy animations. Think 200-300ms, ease-out curves.
5. **Monochromatic with Accent**: Dark backgrounds (deep blacks, navys) or clean whites with one accent color.
6. **Premium Details**: Subtle borders, refined shadows, glass effects, grain textures.

## Aesthetic Guidelines

### Typography
- **Display fonts**: DM Sans, Satoshi, Geist, Instrument Sans, Plus Jakarta Sans, Cabinet Grotesk
- **Body fonts**: Inter (sparingly), SF Pro, System UI for performance
- **Approach**: Large, bold headings with tight letter-spacing. Refined, readable body text.
- **Sizing**: Generous scale difference between heading and body (e.g., 4xl+ headings, base body)

### Color Palette
**Dark themes** (preferred for luxury feel):
- Background: #0a0a0f, #09090b, #0f0f14, #000000
- Surface: rgba(255,255,255,0.02-0.05), subtle glass effects
- Borders: rgba(255,255,255,0.05-0.1)
- Text: White for primary, gray-400/500 for secondary
- Accent: One saturated color (blue, purple, emerald) used sparingly

**Light themes** (when appropriate):
- Background: Pure white #ffffff or warm off-white
- Surface: Subtle grays for cards
- Text: Near-black #09090b
- Accent: Muted, sophisticated tones

### Layout & Spacing
- **Container**: Max-width 1200-1400px, generous horizontal padding (6-8 units)
- **Sections**: 24-32 units vertical padding
- **Grid**: Clean, asymmetric when purposeful
- **Cards**: Subtle borders, large border-radius (xl-3xl), minimal shadow

### Motion & Interaction
- **Transitions**: 200-400ms, ease-out or custom cubic-bezier
- **Hover states**: Subtle scale (1.02), opacity shifts, border color changes
- **Page loads**: Gentle fade-in or slide-up with staggered delays
- **Avoid**: Bouncy animations, excessive movement, attention-grabbing effects

### Visual Details
- **Gradients**: Subtle, often radial, for depth and atmosphere
- **Shadows**: Very subtle or none. When used, multi-layer for realism
- **Borders**: 1px, low opacity, creates definition without heaviness
- **Blur effects**: Backdrop blur for glass morphism when appropriate
- **Texture**: Subtle grain overlays add premium feel

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

- Colorful gradients on buttons
- Heavy drop shadows
- Excessive border-radius (full rounded on large elements)
- Multiple accent colors competing
- Busy backgrounds or patterns
- Generic stock illustrations
- Cluttered layouts with too many elements
- Animations that delay content visibility
- Cookie-cutter component libraries without customization

## Implementation Standards

Then implement working code (React/TypeScript for this project) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually refined and premium
- Cohesive with intentional restraint
- Meticulously polished in every detail

## Project-Specific Context

This is a **Freelancelyst** - a Next.js 15 (App Router) project for a web development agency. When building frontend components:

- Use React with TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the existing component structure in `app/_components/`
- Place landing page components in `app/_components/landing/`
- Supports i18n with `lang` prop (TLocale type)
- Dark theme is the default (#0a0a0f background)
- Use lodash `get()` for safe dictionary access
- Accent color: Blue (#3b82f6 / blue-500) with purple secondary

### Design Reference
The current landing page follows evo-mobile.ru style:
- Deep black backgrounds
- Blue gradient accents
- Clean card layouts with subtle borders
- Generous spacing
- Professional, trustworthy feel

Remember: Luxury is in the restraint. Modern is in the simplicity. Quality is in the details.
